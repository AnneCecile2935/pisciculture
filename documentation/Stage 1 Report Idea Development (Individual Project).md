  - Idea      C: High cost and technical complexity.



## 4. Decision and Selected MVP

**Chosen MVP:** Web and mobile application for feeding and stock tracking. **Problem Solved:** Fish farmers waste time with paper notes for stock, feed, transfers, and meals.

**Target Users:** Managers and employees of small/medium fish farms (1‚Äì2 sites, 5‚Äì20 ponds).

**Key Features:**

- **User     Management:** Admin and employee roles.
- **Sites/Ponds:** CRUD for     sites and ponds (names, types).
- **Feed:** CRUD for     feed types (name, quantity, expiration date).
- **Meals:** Log     meals (site, pond, feed type, quantity, date).
- **Batches:** Create     batches (origin, quantity, date, initial pond).
- **Transfers:** Transfer     batches between ponds (with history).
- **Feed     Stock:** Track feed inventory (low-stock alerts).
- **Fish     Stock:** Monitor fish stock per pond.

**Expected Outcomes:** Improved traceability, simplified tracking, reduced errors.

**Selection Rationale:** Balances feasibility and impact; innovative solution for the client.

**Challenges and Opportunities:**

- **Challenge:** Ensure     data synchronization between web and mobile apps. *Solution:* Use     Django REST Framework for a shared API; offline-local cache for mobile.
- **Opportunity:** Add     predictive analytics/recommendations post-MVP.

**Technologies:**

- **Back-end:** Django +     PostgreSQL (robust for complex relationships; built-in admin).
- **Front-end:**     Bootstrap + JavaScript.
- **Hosting:** Heroku     or Railway.
